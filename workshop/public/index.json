Amazon OpenSearch Service. You will explore the basics of ingesting, analyzing and visualizing data.\nIn the workshop CloudWatch Log Collection you will learn how to send logs - in real time - from AWS CloudWatch to Amazon OpenSearch Service. Once in OpenSearch you can analyze your CloudWatch logs and help identify errors and issues.\nIn the workshop Fluentd Log Ingestion you will learn how to use Fluentd an Opensource data collector to send logs in real time to Amazon OpenSearch Service.\nIn the workshop Anomaly Detection with MSK you will learn how to use the anomaly detection feature in OpenSearch to identify potential anomalous data. Additionally, you will learn a method of ingesting data into OpenSearch in real time via. Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) and a Lambda function.\nIn the workshop OpenSearch Alerting you will learn how to set up alerts in Amazon OpenSearch. This allows you to get a notification when a condition is met in your log data.\n"

	"content": "Step 1 - Install Fluentd You need to install Fluentd in the Cloud9 environment. The Cloud9 environment is based on an Ubuntu linux EC2 machine. you will follow the instructions for installing Fluentd on Ubuntu\nIn the Cloud9 terminal execute the following commands\n gem install fluentd --no-doc gem install fluent-plugin-opensearch  Step 2 - Setup Fluentd After installing Fluentd to create a new project execute the following command on the Cloud9 terminal\n fluentd --setup ./fluent  This will create a new folder in Cloud9 with a fluent.conf file. you will edit the fluent.conf file to configure Fluentd\nOpen the flunt.conf file in Cloud9  Delete all of the code in the file and replace it with the code below  \u0026lt;source\u0026gt;\r@type tail\rpath /var/log/apache2/access.log\rpos_file /var/log/td-agent/apache2.access_log.pos\rtag os.apache.access\rformat apache2\r\u0026lt;/source\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;match match os.*.*\u0026gt;\r@type opensearch\rinclude_timestamp true\rindex_name fluentd\r\u0026lt;endpoint\u0026gt;\rurl \u0026lt;opensearch_domain_endpoint\u0026gt;\rregion \u0026lt;aws_region\u0026gt;\raccess_key_id \u0026lt;your_aws_id\u0026gt;\rsecret_access_key \u0026lt;your_aws_security_key\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/endpoint\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/match\u0026gt;\rEdit to the new fluent.conf file replace the following\nReplace \u0026lt;opensearch_domain_endpoint\u0026gt; with the value of the OSDomainURL key from the CloudFormation stack outputs Replace \u0026lt;aws_region\u0026gt; with the value of the Region key from the CloudFormation stack outputs Replace \u0026lt;your_aws_id\u0026gt; with the value of the AccessKeyId key from the CloudFormation stack outputs Replace \u0026lt;your_aws_security_key\u0026gt; with the value of the SecretAccessKey key from the CloudFormation stack outputs  Save the fluent.conf file  Step 3 - Run Fluentd Now that you have installed and configured Fluentd (via. updating the fluent.conf file) it is time to run Fluentd. To run Fluentd\nBefore you can run Fluentd you need to open permissions on two folders within the EC2 instance the Cloud9 runs on. Run the following commands in the Cloud9 terminal\n sudo mkdir /var/log/apache2/ sudo chmod 777 /var/log/apache2/ sudo mkdir /var/log/td-agent/ sudo chmod 777 /var/log/td-agent/  Note: you may get a \u0026lsquo;cannot create directory: file exists error\u0026rsquo;. If this occurs, you can ignore and continue\n\rYou can now start Fluntd by running the following command in the Cloud9 console\nfluentd -c ./fluent/fluent.conf -vv\nThe -vv flag enables verbose logging. This allows us to more easily keep track on Fluentd\u0026rsquo;s actions.\nStep 4 - Create Sample Apache Log Fluentd is watching the access.log file. By default this file has no log data for Fluentd to parse and send to OpenSearch.\nTo generate sample log data for Fluentd to process\n Open a new terminal window in Cloud9 by clicking on the plus symbol next to the current terminal and selecting New Terminal  In the new terminal execute the following command  ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost/\nRunning this command will generate 10000 sample logs in the access.log file Fluentd is monitoring\nFluentd will recognize the new entries have been added to the access.log file and will parse, send the log data to OpenSearch.\nYou can now move on the next step Search Log to view and search the logs Fluentd sent to OpenSearch.\n"

In order to send logs to OpenSearch via Kinesis Data Firehose we need to grant the IAM role that firehose uses permissions in OpenSearch.\nMap IAM Role with OpenSeach Role  Go to the OpenSearch Console Click on the workshop-domain OpenSearch domain you created earlier Click on the OpenSearch Dashboard URL. This should open the URL in a web browser window  You will be prompted to log in. Using the user name OSMasterUser and password AwS#OpenSearch1 log in If an additional pop up window is present after login asking about data upload click on Explore on my own If an additional pop up windows is present asking you to select your tenant select Global and click on Confirm  You should now see a window that looks like this\nClick on and expand the hamburger menu on the side bar of the OpenSearch home page Under the OpenSearch Plugins section click on Security  On the security page click on Roles from the left hand menu  On the roles page search for and click on all_access  On the all_access role page click on Mapped users Under the mapped users page click on Manage mapping  On the manage mapping page we need to map the IAM role the is used by Kinesis Data Firehose to the all_access OpenSearch role. This will give Kinesis Firehose the permissions it need to create, update indexes and write data.\nFor the purposes of this lab we will give Kinesis Firehose all_access in OpenSearch.\nWe need to find the ARN of the IAM role Kinesis Firehose is using. Keeping the Manage mapping page open in your browser, navigate to a new tab and\nGo to the Kinesis Firehose Console Click on the workshop-firehose listed. This is the Kinesis Data Fire hose we created earlier Click on the Configuration section  On the configuration page scroll down to the permissions section Click on the IAM role  This will open a new window in your web browser. Copy down the ARN of the IAM role  Navigate back to the OpenSearch map user tab Enter the ARN we copied in step 18 and paste it in the backend roles section of OpenSearch console page Click on Map  Our AWS environment set up. When you are ready begin the next step Send Log Data to Kinesis Fire Hose\n"
